Let's continue refactoring our `backend` docker compose environment, and get a proper template structure, environment variable and service entrypoint management solution completed. In our last session, we started in the `backend` folder, making the base templates and such. Let's continue from where we left off, by observing and updating the `PROIRITY.md` file with the latest status and priorities. We can then use that file to drive our next objectives.
